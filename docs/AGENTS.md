# AGENTS.md (docs)

Scope: `docs/**`

## Purpose

This folder stores feature design docs, architecture notes, gates, and runbooks.

## Start Here

- Agent navigation index: `docs/AGENT_NAVIGATION.md`
- QA suite reference: `docs/qa-gate-command-suite.md`
- Contract gate reference: `docs/contracts-validation-gates.md`
- Ops runbook: `docs/operations-runbook.md`

## Doc Update Rules

- Describe the current state, not migration history.
- Keep commands copy-paste runnable from repository root.
- If command/script behavior changes, update docs in the same change set.
